					Siberian Huskies have captured the imagination of the masses, as well as artists, writers, and film producers, with their eye-catching looks and awe-inspiring talents. This medium-size working dog possesses power and athleticism. First developed as sled dogs, some are still used in this capacity Huskies are remarkable dogs and their ability to learn is staggering. Many have fallen in love with the wild nature and pride of Huskies, but are unaware just what this breed is truly like. This is not a breed for everyone. Their beauty often drives people to purchase them, unaware of their difficult traits, which makes many Siberian Huskies prime candidates for shelters. The increasing popularity of the breed has led to puppy mills and backyard breeders who do not properly breed for temperament. This is having an adverse effect on the breed at large and many of the negative traits are becoming common in these ill-bred dogs, including some traits that are not normal for Siberian Huskies. If you look at all the positive points of their temperaments, you are left without any doubt that this is an amazing breed. They are intelligent and independent. They are affectionate with everyone but do not need to constantly pester you for attention. They are not known to be aggressive and generally do well in multi-dog homes. They do well with children and will welcome everyone into their home...yes, even intruders. However, they often use that remarkable mind to learn less savory things and are not overly eager to please their people. They are extremely difficult to train, so first-time dog owners or timid people should consider other breeds. Huskies fit best with confident, experienced dog owners who set rules and deliver consistency. Like all breeds, Huskies need obedience training, but they seem to have an uncanny ability to distinguish the difference between home and class â€” behaving beautifully in class while disregarding commands when at home. The biggest caution about Siberian Huskies is their reputation for being escape artists. They will wander away from home whenever they get the chance. Sadly, far too many have become lost or injured as a result. It's vital for Siberian Husky owners to constantly check their yards for any means of escape and to surround their yard with a fence sunk into the ground. Although they have many qualities that can make them difficult, Siberian Huskies are still a wonderful breed. Fans of this spirited breed embrace their wonderful natures. When properly trained and cared for, Huskies make wonderful family companions.
